description: Launch the contextscope dashboard (per-turn token context audit + session analytics for Claude Code). Spawns a local server in the background and prints the URL.
allowed-tools: Bash
---

The user wants to open the contextscope dashboard. Run this **once** in a background bash invocation:

```bash
npx @mbeato/contextscope --no-open > /tmp/contextscope.log 2>&1 &
sleep 2
grep "running on" /tmp/contextscope.log | tail -1
```

Then tell the user:
- the URL printed above
- they can stop it with `pkill -f contextscope` when finished

If `npx @mbeato/contextscope` is not installed, tell the user to install with `npm install -g @mbeato/contextscope` and try again.

Do not analyze the dashboard yourself — it's a UI for the user.
